In Case if you cant see the options in select or cant translate and detect the language, its because the API has expired

Access the API KEY from this link : https://rapidapi.com/googlecloud/api/google-translate1/pricing

and paste the key on line no 87 , 125 and 146 in translate.js, that's all.
Google Translator API Key demands subscription and the tokens are limited,hence its quite often that the Api key I used will expire
